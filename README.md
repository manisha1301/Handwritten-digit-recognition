# Handwritten-digit-recognition
data science project 


One of the best data mining projects is the Handwritten Digit recognition project among the data scientists and all the machine learning enthusiasts. 
In this project, machine learning algorithms are used to distinguish and classify images of the digits written by hand. 
With the help of computer vision AI model, machine learning techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks, this project can be created which will have a nice graphical user interface to write or draw on the canvas and for the output a model is good to predict the digit.
Python and R, both are good languages for this project. 
Pythonâ€™s Scikit-learn model using algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors and a Support Vector Classifier will be apt for the project.
